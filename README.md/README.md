### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   If you have Git installed, clone the repository:

Open index.html in a web browser by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" to choose your browser.
For testing JavaScript live, you can use an extension like "Live Server" in Visual Studio Code, which auto-refreshes the browser as you edit the files.

For testing dynamic features such as JavaScript functionality, using a live server is recommended. You can use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code to see changes in real-time.

Theme Toggle: The website allows users to switch between Light and Dark themes. Clicking the "Switch Theme" button toggles the website's appearance by adding/removing appropriate theme classes on the body element.
